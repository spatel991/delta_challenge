Delta Challenge (Selenium + Python)

Parts:
1. See the 'delta_booking_test_scenarios_masterlist' document
2. See 'manual_test_case_A004' and 'manual_test_case_F010' document
3. See automated test work in the GitHub repo or included Selenium python scripts.
4. Attempting to automate a sanity test for searching for initial booking ATL<->PBI but faced issues manipulating with the calender component.

Challenges Faced:
1. Focusing on smaller step tests vs full interaction, documenting as I go to not loose thought.
2. Delta's website has a lot of dynamic loading, which caused a lot of browser crashing on my setup during Inspections!
3. Determining if an off-line testing approach is better
4. Testing process took a lot longer due to some areas only being accessible after verified login
5. For challenges not overcome, I commented out sections and came back to it if I found a better way to tackle it.
